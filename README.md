# Campus-Navigation-and-Utility-Planner

## Overview
The **Campus Navigation and Utility Planner** models university buildings, finds optimal paths, and plans resource delivery routes using **trees and graph algorithms**.

This project includes:
- Building storage using **Binary Search Trees**
- Traversal listing of campus locations
- Graph representation using adjacency lists
- **Dijkstra** for shortest path
- **Kruskal MST** for cable layout planning
- **Expression Tree** evaluation for utility bill calculations

## Data Structures Used
| Data Structure | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| Binary Search Tree | Store building information |
| Tree Traversals | List campus locations |
| Graph (Adjacency List) | Campus navigation paths |
| Priority Queue | Dijkstra shortest path |
| Union-Find | Kruskal MST |
| Expression Tree | Energy bill computation |

## Learning Outcomes

- Implementation of BST, graph representations, Dijkstra, and MST
- Real world application of tree & graph algorithms
- Understanding traversal, shortest path, and expression evaluation
